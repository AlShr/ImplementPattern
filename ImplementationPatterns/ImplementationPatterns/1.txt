I've spent the last year and a half working full-time as a writer and 
editor for a publishing company that specializes in educational content. 
During that time, I've logged thousands of hours doing everything related 
to the editorial process, including copy editing, proofreading, content entry, 
and quality assurance. I currently manage a team of over 40 freelance writers 
who work on a variety of different subjects, and I ensure that the quality of 
every submission meets our high editorial standards. I'm also very familiar with 
English grammar and usage and have no trouble adapting to various style guides.
